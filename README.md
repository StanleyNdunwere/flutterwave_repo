Merchants: They register on the platform and create products with a price tag for customers or users to buy
Dispactch Riders: They register on the platform to help merchants deliver the products they've purchase to the end users
Users: They register on the platform to look through and purchase products from merchants and have registered riders deliver these products to them
Guests: These are a special case of users who would rather not register on the platform but still want to make purchases nonetheless
